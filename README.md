# Gooey Code

## Building (Development)

To run the development server, run:
``` sh
$ npm run watch
```
This will start a server on `localhost` which can be accessed in your browser.
When a source file is changed, the browser tab will be automatically refreshed.

## Running Tests

To run all of the tests, run:
``` sh
$ npm test
```

To run a particular test, you can run, for example:
``` sh
$  npx mocha -g "Can parse a leaf"
```
This will run the test called "Can parse a leaf".
